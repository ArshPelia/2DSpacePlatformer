# 2DSpacePlatformer
Final Frontier is an action-adventure 2D platformer set in the confines of space and extra-terrestrial planets. The game will potentially consist of four levels consisting of 4 worlds which must be completed in consecutive order. Death results in the player restarting the level, and 3 accumulated deaths require the player to restart the entire game; these lives are restored upon completing a level/planet. Each run of the game requires the player to select a weapon, out of a select few, which they must use for the whole level or risk returning to ship to choose a new weapon at the cost of all enemies resurrecting (Schell 134). Resurrection is limited, for although you are an android, your ship can only construct new artificial limbs in proportion to the moon rocks you provide it with. Once again, returning to ship to invest in an additional life results in levels being repopulated with enemy AI. The design of this mechanic aims to constantly perpetuate an internal conflict within the player between the reward of investing accumulated resources against the risk of repeating the level.


Story Outline

Our journey begins on a terraformed Mars in 2070 AD after decades of overpopulation,
political strife, and pollution have caused the earth to become completely inhabitable. The
player, a former space force lieutenant, wakes up in an android body and is greeted by a group of
scientists who fled the earth shortly before annihilation. You are informed that your
consciousness has been uploaded to an android machine after a doctor retrieved it prior to your
death. Still traumatized, your brain has not entirely recovered resulting in significant portions of
your memory being blocked off as a defence mechanism. Scarred and in unfamiliar territory, you
are designated to find a new home for humanity as the species' last hope. Progressively, each
critical revelation throughout the narrative triggers a flashback, imposing the player to reflect on
how greed, corruption, tribalism and exploitation resulted in the eradication of earth.
In turn, these moments of introspection should force the player to ponder the essence of
humanity as the character questions the legitimacy of his individual identity within an android
husk (Madigan 17-18). Are humans worthy of evolving, or is the current predicament a
consequence of a broken, irreprehensible civilization? What constitutes a human being, an
amalgamation of memories and experiences or biological composition? In the end, you decide
whether to return to the last remaining survivors and migrate them to the new planet or begin a
new race of artificial intelligence with you as its progenitor


GAMEPLAY

The gameplay construct of Final Frontier devises to present a challenging experience
balanced around two core principles; tight 2D platforming and multilayered combat consisting of
long and short-range engagements (Katie and Zimmerman 316-317). Inspired by acclaimed
Metroidvanias such as hollow knight and retro platformers, Final Frontier aims to deliver a
product that incorporates the principle mechanics from the two genres i.e. an “analogy”
(Friedman 295). As such, progression through the game leads to accumulating new traversal
abilities and combat mechanics to conjure an impression of growth within the player.
Correspondingly, as the player's collection of tools expands with their proficiency in the move
set, the level design will test their mastery over a particular game mechanic aspect. This
translates to levels focused around platform traversal with timed and dynamic obstacles requiring
a specific movement scheme such as dash or double jump in gameplay. On the other hand,
projectile/melee combat sections will blend quick but relatively weak enemies in contrast to
stronger adversaries with more perceptible attack animations.

Every playthrough begins with the player traversing the planet of Mars to collect enough
fuel (moon rocks) for his adventure to foreign planets. This initial level introduces the player to
the controller logistics through a series of trivial combat and platforming engagements. Upon
collecting the requisite moon rocks to fuel your ship, the player embarks on the first potentially
habitable planet, XENA-2M5. Player progression consists of upgrading weapons and equipment
using biofuel collected from deceased organic lifeforms, and additional androids (lives) come at
the cost of rare moon rocks scattered across the levels by random generation.
In place of a difficulty slider, the game is designed to encourage improvement through
accumulated knowledge of exploiting enemy movement and projectile weaknesses as a product
of repeated playthroughs. For instance, veteran players should know which gun is best suited for
the corresponding level. Equivalently, not only does the player grow from each failure, but so
does your AI companion, who can analyze your past mistakes. To avoid a difficulty barrier for
novice gamers, the player is provided with an option to learn from his mistakes by asking the
ship's AI how they messed up or hints for challenging boss battles (Katie and Zimmerman
321-322).

CHARACTER

Final Frontier's protagonist is a bionic automaton whose consciousness was uploaded to
an A.I. software in the process of being transferred to its cyborg host. In his previous life, the
protagonist served as a high-ranking lieutenant in the United Nations Space Force before his
demise in combat during the Great Rebellion. Upon resurrection, the host's mind is resistant to
acclimation following a brutal death due to severe post-traumatic stress disorder. In turn, the
protagonist suffers from memory loss, particularly concerning the macabre periods of his
lifetime.

During combat deployment, he witnessed the most despicable and the noblest aspects of
human nature, providing him with a profound yet conflicted insight towards humanity.
Furthermore, the protagonist's inadequacy to form intimate relationships during his life on earth
invokes little resentment over the state of the earth. Although he may initially view the absence
of affection as an asset, the gravity of loneliness in an empty, hostile space will challenge this
notion towards companionship. He embarks towards alien civilizations not with a combative
perspective but rather an impartial one.
Nevertheless, the protagonist's sense of honour and duty, the traits acquired over a
lengthy military career, invoke a sentiment of responsibility to overcome his insurmountable
task. Likewise, decades of intensive training greatly aid in translating his muscle memory
proficiency across multiple resurrections and androids. Additionally, weapons expertise and
aerial prowess in space provide him with the optimal tools to survive on his mission. Finally, the
protagonist’s weapon of choice is a U.N.S.F.-issued tactical laser pistol.
