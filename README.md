# 2DSpacePlatformer
Final Frontier is an action-adventure 2D platformer set in the confines of space and extra-terrestrial planets. The game will potentially consist of four levels consisting of 4 worlds which must be completed in consecutive order. Death results in the player restarting the level, and 3 accumulated deaths require the player to restart the entire game; these lives are restored upon completing a level/planet. Each run of the game requires the player to select a weapon, out of a select few, which they must use for the whole level or risk returning to ship to choose a new weapon at the cost of all enemies resurrecting (Schell 134). Resurrection is limited, for although you are an android, your ship can only construct new artificial limbs in proportion to the moon rocks you provide it with. Once again, returning to ship to invest in an additional life results in levels being repopulated with enemy AI. The design of this mechanic aims to constantly perpetuate an internal conflict within the player between the reward of investing accumulated resources against the risk of repeating the level.
